<img src="comp.jpg" align="left"  class="rectangle" />



 	<p> I am Mercedes Smith and I attended Holy Childhood High before starting the University of the West Indies. I grew up and spent my whole life in Kingston, Jamaica. After graduating I plan to obtain my Graduates Degree in Computing. My future company,Sedecrem Industries, will be the new face of technology, taking over the now 'popular' tech giants such as Apple, Microsoft and Google. This is only the dream of a computer science student but it shall soon be reality in the next coming years. Sedecrem Industries aims to completely revolutionize how personal devices are being used in today's age. Imagine using a cellphone that never has to be charged again or a personal computer with a camera quality better than your cellphone.

	<p>She needed glasses. It wasn't that she couldn't see without them, but what she could see with them. When she wore glasses, her eyes focused so deeply that she could see not only the physical but also beyond. It was like a superpower. But she needed glasses. The amber droplet hung from the branch, reaching fullness and ready to drop. It waited. While many of the other droplets were satisfied to form as big as they could and release, this droplet had other plans. It wanted to be part of history. It wanted to be remembered long after all the other droplets had dissolved into history. So it waited for the perfect specimen to fly by to trap and capture that it hoped would eventually be discovered hundreds of years in the future.In order to build Sedecrem, a driven innovative team is needed to complete the vision. If you would like to be apart of the time and contact me on any of the social media platforms linked in the site. If you would like to be apart of this long and hopefully succesfully journey like, comment, share and subscribe. Question of the day, where do you think I got the name for this tech company?</p>

A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to tackle writers' block. Writing block can often happen due to being stuck with a current project that the writer is trying to complete. By inserting a completely random paragraph from which to begin, it can take down some of the issues that may have been causing the writers' block in the first place. The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing. </p>
